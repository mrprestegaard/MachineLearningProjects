# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my machine learning project repository! This repository contains various machine learning projects that cover a wide range of topics, from classification tasks using decision trees to text mining and neural network implementations. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **HR Data Analytics: Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification**
In this project, I analyze an HR dataset to predict employee turnover and other HR-related metrics. I implement both Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to make predictions based on various employee attributes like performance ratings, years of experience, and more.

- **Key Topics Covered**: 
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Feature Engineering
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Model Evaluation (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

### 2. **Text Marketing Analysis using Twitter Data and Network Visualizations**
This project involves analyzing Twitter data to study the marketing impact of specific keywords, hashtags, and user interactions. I use network visualization techniques to explore the connections between tweets, users, and hashtags to identify trends and sentiment around marketing campaigns.

- **Key Topics Covered**:
  - Twitter Data Collection using Tweepy
  - Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, etc.)
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Network Analysis and Visualization (Graph Creation with libraries like NetworkX)
  - Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

### 3. **Keyword Extraction using Unsupervised Learning (NMF and LDA)**
This project focuses on extracting meaningful keywords from a large corpus of documents using two popular unsupervised learning techniques: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The goal is to uncover hidden topics in the text data.

- **Key Topics Covered**:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, Count Vectorization)
  - Topic Modeling using NMF
  - Topic Modeling using LDA
  - Visualization of Topics and Keywords

### 4. **PyTorch Neural Network for Beginners**
This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to neural networks using PyTorch. I build and train a simple neural network from scratch to solve a basic classification task. The notebook explains the architecture, training process, and how to evaluate the model.

- **Key Topics Covered**:
  - Neural Network Basics
  - PyTorch Fundamentals
  - Building a Simple Feedforward Neural Network
  - Model Training and Evaluation (Accuracy, Loss, etc.)
  - Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
